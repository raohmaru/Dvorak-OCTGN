Dvorak Card Game plugin for OCTGN
================================

A game definition plugin for the free card game engine [OCTGN 3](http://kellyelton.github.com/OCTGN/). This plugin is made to allow online playing with Dvorak "playable" decks, as a generic game definition. It has basic functions to play any kind of deck found at <http://www.dvorakgame.co.uk/index.php/Category:Playable_decks>.

You will also need to get a OCTGN set to play. I'm am working on a "Dvorak deck in Lackey format to OCTGN set" converter, stay tuned.

The python script is based on the great [Doomtown CCG definition](https://github.com/db0/Doomtown-for-OCTGN) by Konstantine Thoukydides.

About Dvorak
--------------

[Dvorak](http://www.dvorakgame.co.uk) is a card game invented by [Kevan Davis](http://kevan.org/). People can use the Dvorak system as a skeleton for making a solid and standalone card game. Over the years the number of games created by users has been increasing, and new variants have been added like CCG (collectible card games) decks.
